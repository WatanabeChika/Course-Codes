/** File: main.cpp
 * ----------------
 * This file computes the plans for three scenarios of dividing balls into buckets.
 * 
 * Organize the project yourself. The project should have the following structures:
 * 
 *  - main.cpp
 *    + main function to process input/output
 *    + countPlanA/countPlanB/countPlanC functions
 * 
 *  - combinatorics.h: interfaces for
 *    + permutations
 *    + combinations
 * 
 *  - combinatorics.cpp: implementations for
 *    + permutations that does not use factorial
 *    + combinations that does not use factorial
 *
