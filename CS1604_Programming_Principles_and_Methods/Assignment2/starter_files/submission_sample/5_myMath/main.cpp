/** File: main.cpp
 * ----------------
 * This file demonstrates the library of GCD and LCM functions.
 * 
 * Organize the project yourself. The project should have the following structure:
 * 
 *  - main.cpp
 *    + `void gcd_lcm(int m, int n)` that calls the `gcd` and `lcm` in the math library
 *      and computes the GCD and LCM of m and n
 *    + main function to process input/output, and call functions `gcd_lcm` and `factorial`
 * 
 * Note that input/output should be handled by the main function instead of gcd_lcm
 * and that computation should be done in the gcd_lcm function. 
 * Find a way to pass the computation result in gcd_lcm to the main function
 * 
 *  - myMath.h: interfaces for
 *    + gcd
 *    + lcm
 *    + factorial
 * 
 *  - myMath.cpp: implementations for
 *    + gcd in a tail recursive way
 *    + lcm
 *    + factorial in a tail recursive way
 * 
 *  The interface should **NOT** expose any implementation details, in particular,
 *  the tail recursive implementation of factorial.
