## Description

This problem is about implementing an algorithm for calculating $a^n(mod~2019)$, following the idea of the fast algorithm for computing powers of numbers (Binary Exponentiation).

Fast power, is a trick to efficiently calculate $a ^ n$. A direct computation by multiplying $a$ with itself does not work well when $n$ is too large. We know that $a^{b+c}=a^b\times a^c,a^{2b}=(a^b)^2$. The idea of binary exponentiation is utilize this fact to divide the computation into smaller tasks according to the binary representation of $n$. 

First, we take the binary form of $n$. For example:

$3^{13}=3^{(1101)_2}=3^8\times 3^4 \times 3^1$

Because $n$ has $\lfloor log_2n \rfloor+1$ bits, we can calculate the values of $a^1,a^2,a^4,a^8,\cdots,a^{2^{\lfloor log_2n \rfloor}}$ by multiplying only $\lfloor log_2n \rfloor$ times. Take 3 as an example:

$3^1=3$

$3^2=(3^1)^2=3^2=9$

$3^4=(3^2)^2=9^2=81$

$3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2=6561$

In order to calculate $3 ^ {13} $, we only need to find out which digits are $1$ in the binary form of $n$, and take the multiplication of the corresponding values in the above sequence:

$3^{13}=3^{(1101)_2}=3^8\times 3^4 \times 3^1=6561\times 81\times 3=1594323$

Formally, if we write $n$ as binary $\left(n_{t} n_{t-1} \cdots n_{1} n_{0}\right)_{2}$ï¼Œ, we have 

$n=n_{t} 2^{t}+n_{t-1} 2^{t-1}+n_{t-2} 2^{t-2}+\cdots+n_{1} 2^{1}+n_{0} 2^{0}$

where $n_{i} \in 0,1$. Then

$a^{n}=\left(a^{n_{t} 2^{t}+\cdots+n_{0} 2^{0}}\right)=a^{n_{0} 2^{0}} \times a^{n_{1} 2^{1}} \times \cdots \times a^{n_{t} 2^{t}}$

**Hint**: To avoid overflow in multiplication, you will need to use the fact: $(a\times b)~mod~ c = (a~mod~ c) \times   (b ~mod~ c) ~mod~ c$
