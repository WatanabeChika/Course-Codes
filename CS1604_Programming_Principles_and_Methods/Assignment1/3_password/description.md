### Description

Given a four-digit number, encrypt and output it. The encryption method is to, for every digit in the number, first add `5` to it and then convert it into an capitalized English letter. The mapping between numbers to letters for the conversion is: `1` mapped to `A`, `2` mapped to `B`,..., `26` mapped to `Z`.
