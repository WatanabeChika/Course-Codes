Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu[1]
is a hill near Porangahau, south of Waipukurau in southern Hawke's Bay,
New Zealand. The height of the hill is 305 metres (1,001 ft). The hill
is notable primarily for its unusually long name, which is of Maori
origin; it is often shortened to Taumata for brevity.[2] It has gained a
measure of fame as it is the longest place name found in any
English-speaking country, and possibly the longest place name in the
world, according to World Atlas.[3] The name of the hill (with 85
characters) has also been listed in the Guinness World Records as the
longest place name. Other versions of the name, including longer ones,
are also sometimes used.
