This is the directory under which the judger will try to find your source files.
You should arrange your source files in the following structure:
```
|- 1_line_wrap           // Part 1
|  |- main.cpp
|
|- 2_identifierify       // Part 2
|  |- main.cpp
|
|- 3_fuzzy_search        // Part 3
|  |- main.cpp
|
|- 4_syllabic_palindrome // Part 4
   |- main.cpp
```
When you're going to submit your work, you simply include those 4 directories
in a ZIP archive named after your student number.
- Your submitted archive is allowed to contain other files like Code::Blocks
  project files; they'll be ignored by the final judger.
