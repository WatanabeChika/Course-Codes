polylogarithmicIn mathematics, a polylogarithmic function in  is a polynomial in the logarithm of ,The notation  is often used as a shorthand for , analogous to  for .In computer science, polylogarithmic functions occur as the order of time or memory used by some algorithms (e.g., "it has polylogarithmic order").All polylogarithmic functions of  are  for every exponent  (for the meaning of this symbol, see small o notation), that is, a polylogarithmic function grows more slowly than any positive exponent.  This observation is the basis for the soft O notation .Black, Paul E. (2004-12-17). "polylogarithmic". Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures.
