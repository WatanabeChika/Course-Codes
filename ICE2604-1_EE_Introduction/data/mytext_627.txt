model_of_computationIn computer science, and more specifically in computability theory and computational complexity theory, a model of computation is a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input. A model describes how units of computations, memories, and communications are organized.[1] The computational complexity of an algorithm can be measured given a model of computation. Using a model allows studying the performance of algorithms independently of the variations that are specific to particular implementations and specific technology.Models of computation can be classified into three categories: sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models.Sequential models include:Finite state machinesPost machines (Post–Turing machines and tag machines).Pushdown automataRegister machinesRandom-access machinesTuring machinesDecision tree modelFunctional models include:Abstract rewriting systemsCombinatory logicGeneral recursive functionsLambda calculusConcurrent models include:Actor modelCellular automatonInteraction netsKahn process networksLogic gates and digital circuitsPetri netsSynchronous Data FlowSome of these models have both deterministic and  nondeterministic variants. Nondeterministic models are not useful for practical computation;[] they are used in the study of computational complexity of algorithms.Models differ in their expressive power; for example, each function that can be computed by a Finite state machine can also be computed by a Turing machine, but not vice versa.In the field of runtime analysis of algorithms, it is common to specify a  computational model in terms of primitive operations allowed which have unit cost, or simply unit-cost operations. A commonly used example is the random-access machine, which has unit cost for read and write access to all of its memory cells. In this respect, it differs from the above-mentioned Turing machine model.Stack machine (0-operand machine)Accumulator machine (1-operand machine)Register machine (2,3,... operand machine)Random-access machineAbstract machineCell-probe modelRobertson–Webb query modelChomsky hierarchyTuring completenessFernández, Maribel (2009).
