<div class="mw-parser-output">
<p>In computer science (particularly algorithmics), a <b>polynomial-time approximation scheme</b> (<b>PTAS</b>) is a type of approximation algorithm for optimization problems (most often, NP-hard optimization problems).
</p><p>A PTAS is an algorithm which takes an instance of an optimization problem and a parameter <span class="texhtml">ε &gt; 0</span> and produces a solution that is within a factor <span class="texhtml">1 + ε</span> of being optimal (or <span class="texhtml">1 – ε</span> for maximization problems). For example, for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem, a PTAS would produce a tour with length at most <span class="texhtml">(1 + ε)<i>L</i></span>, with <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">L</span> being the length of the shortest tour.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</sup>
</p><p>The running time of a PTAS is required to be polynomial in the problem size for every fixed ε, but can be different for different ε. Thus an algorithm running in time <span class="texhtml"><i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1/ε</sup>)</span> or even <span class="texhtml"><i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>exp(1/ε)</sup>)</span> counts as a PTAS.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deterministic">Deterministic</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>A practical problem with PTAS algorithms is that the exponent of the polynomial could increase dramatically as ε shrinks, for example if the runtime is <span class="texhtml"><i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>(1/ε)!</sup>)</span>. One way of addressing this is to define the <b>efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme</b> or <b>EPTAS</b>, in which the running time is required to be <span class="texhtml"><i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup><i>c</i></sup>)</span> for a constant <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">c</span> independent of <span class="texhtml">ε</span>. This ensures that an increase in problem size has the same relative effect on runtime regardless of what ε is being used; however, the constant under the big-O can still depend on ε arbitrarily. 
</p><p>Even more restrictive, and useful in practice, is the <i>fully polynomial-time approximation scheme</i> or <b>FPTAS</b>, which requires the algorithm to be polynomial in both the problem size <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">n</span> and <span class="texhtml">1/ε</span>. 
</p><p>Unless P = NP, it holds that <span class="nowrap">FPTAS ⊊ PTAS ⊊ APX</span>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Jansen_2-0">[2]</sup> Consequently, under this assumption, APX-hard problems do not have PTASs.
</p><p>Another deterministic variant of the PTAS is the <b>quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme</b> or <b>QPTAS</b>. A QPTAS has time complexity <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i><sup>polylog(<i>n</i>)</sup></span> for each fixed <span class="texhtml">ε &gt; 0</span>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Randomized">Randomized</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>Some problems which do not have a PTAS may admit a randomized algorithm with similar properties, a <b>polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme</b> or <b>PRAS</b>.  A PRAS is an algorithm which takes an instance of an optimization or counting problem and a parameter <span class="texhtml">ε &gt; 0</span> and, in polynomial time, produces a solution that has a <i>high probability</i> of being within a factor <span class="texhtml">ε</span> of optimal.  Conventionally, "high probability" means probability greater than 3/4, though as with most probabilistic complexity classes the definition is robust to variations in this exact value (the bare minimum requirement is generally greater than 1/2).  Like a PTAS, a PRAS must have running time polynomial in <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic;">n</span>, but not necessarily in <span class="texhtml">ε</span>; with further restrictions on the running time in <span class="texhtml">ε</span>, one can define an <b>efficient polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme</b> or <b>EPRAS</b> similar to the EPTAS, and a <b>fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme</b> or <b>FPRAS</b> similar to the FPTAS.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-vvv_3-0">[3]</sup>

<p>The term PTAS may also be used to refer to the class of optimization problems that have a PTAS.  PTAS is a subset of APX, and unless P = NP, it is a strict subset. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Jansen_2-1">[2]</sup>
</p><p>Membership in PTAS can be shown using a PTAS reduction, L-reduction, or P-reduction, all of which preserve PTAS membership, and these may also be used to demonstrate PTAS-completeness.  On the other hand, showing non-membership in PTAS (namely, the nonexistence of a PTAS), may be done by showing that the problem is APX-hard, after which the existence of a PTAS would show P = NP.  APX-hardness is commonly shown via PTAS reduction or AP-reduction.
