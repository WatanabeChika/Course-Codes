arrayAn array is a systematic arrangement of similar objects, usually in rows and columns.Things called an array include:In twelve-tone and serial composition, the presentation of simultaneous twelve-tone sets such that the sums of their horizontal segments form a succession of twelve-tone aggregatesArray mbira, a musical instrumentSpiral array model, a music pitch spaceA telescope array, also called astronomical interferometer.Various kinds of multiple biological arrays called microarraysVisual feature array, a model for the visual cortexGenerally, a collection of same type data items that can be selected by indices computed at run-time, including:Array data structure, an arrangement of items at equally spaced addresses in computer memoryArray data type, used in a programming language to specify a variable that can be indexedAssociative array, an abstract data structure model composed of key-value pairs, often implemented as a hash table or search treeor various kinds of the above, such as:Bit array or bit vectorDynamic array, allocated at run timeJagged array, a multidimensional array where the rows have different lengths individuallyParallel array of records, with each field stored as a separate arraySparse array, with most elements omitted, to store a sparse matrixVariable-length arrayor various related concepts:Array programming, using matrix algebra notation in programs (not the same as array processing)Array slicing, the extraction of sub-arrays of an arrayor also:Global Arrays, a library for parallel processingIntel Array Visualizer, a piece of scientific graphics softwareA standard array in coding theoryAn array or matrix (mathematics)a Costas arraya Monge arrayA holorIn statistics, arrays are a name for some kinds of Category:Experimental designIntersection array a concept of category theoryArray data structure, an arrangement of data in computer memoryAsynchronous array of simple processorsDisk array, such as the RAIDGate array, including a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)ICL Distributed Array Processor, an array processor for the ICLIntegrated circuit packages:Ball grid arraypin grid arrayland grid arrayProcessor arrayProgrammable Array Logic (PAL), a systematic way to implement boolean functionsReconfigurable datapath array, a flexible data processing architectureSystolic array, a hardware architectureTransistor array, an integrated circuitVideo Graphics Array (VGA), a display adapter and many variants thereofWi-Fi array, a wireless networking deviceAntenna arrayArray gain, a telecommunications parameterArray processing of multichannel signals (not to be confused with array programming)Color filter array, placed over an imaging arrayField emitter array, an electron sourceHalbach array, an arrangement of magnetsLinear diode array used in image scannersMicrophone arrayParametric array of transducersPhased-array opticsPhotovoltaic arrayStaring array, an imaging sensorTowed array sonarA Commission of Array, a commission for mustering a militiaARRAY, an independent film distribution companyArray Networks, a computer networking companyArray Collective, a Belfast-based artist-activist collaborative project
