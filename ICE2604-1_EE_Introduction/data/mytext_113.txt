He was appointed Vicar of St Swithun's Bintree with Themelthorpe in 1895, after being presented to the benefice by Charles Rawdon-Hastings, Earl of Loudoun and Lord Hastings.Enraght's belief in the Church of England's Catholic tradition, his promotion of ritualism in worship, and his writings on Catholic Worship and Church-State relationships, led him into conflict with the Public Worship Regulation Act of 1874. While serving as Vicar of Holy Trinity, Bordesley, Birmingham, he paid the ultimate price under the act of prosecution and imprisonment in Warwick prison in 1880–1881.Enraght died on St Matthew's Day, September 21, 1898 and is buried at the south-east end of St Swithun's churchyard, Bintree. His grave is that of a “Confessor” (someone who suffered for the faith, while not dying for it). Two windows of the Lady Chapel, depicting the Annunciation of Our Lady are dedicated to Enraght as well as a statue of St Swithun above the porch, inscribed: “It is placed as a memorial to a great and good priest, Richard William Enraght”.John Astley, Rector 1759–1771[4]St. Swithun's Churchyard holds a stone plaque dedicated to the memory of the men from Bintree who fell in the world wars.
