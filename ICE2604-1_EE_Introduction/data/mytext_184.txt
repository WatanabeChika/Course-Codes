chainA chain is a serial assembly of connected pieces, called links, typically made of metal, with an overall character similar to that of a rope in that it is flexible and curved in compression but linear, rigid, and load-bearing in tension. A chain may consist of two or more links. Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: Those designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types.Those designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chains.Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis.Load can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper. Uses for chain include:Belly chain, type of body jewelry worn around the waistJewelry chain, many necklaces and bracelets are made out of small chains of gold and silverChain of office, collar or heavy gold chain worn as insignia of office or a mark of fealty in medieval Europe and the United KingdomDecorating clothing, some people wear wallets with chains connected to their belts, or pants decorated with chainsOmega chain, a pseudo-chain where the 'links' are mounted on a backing rather than being interlinkedTie chain, used to hold in place a tie to the underlying shirt frontBicycle chain, transfers power from the pedals to the drive-wheel of a bicycle, thus propelling it. An application of roller chain.Chain drive, the main feature that differentiated the safety bicycle[]Chain gun, type of machine gun that is driven by an external power source, sometimes connected by a chain, to actuate the mechanism rather than using recoilChain pumps, type of water pump where a loop of chain inset discs is passed around then through a tube submerged in liquidChainsaw, portable mechanical, motorized saw using a cutting chain to saw woodTiming chain, used to transfer rotational position from the crankshaft to the valve and ignition system on an internal combustion engine, typically with a 2:1 speed reduction.Ball and chain, a phrase that can refer to either the actual restraint device that was used to slow down prisoners, or a derogatory description of a person's significant otherBelly chain (or waist chain), a physical restraint worn by prisoners, consisting of a chain around the prisoner's waist, to which the prisoner's hands are chained or cuffed Bicycle lock (or bicycle chain), lockable chainChain boom, large chains used to exclude warships from harbors and riversChain link fencing, fencing that utilizes vertical wires that are bent in a zigzag fashion and linked to each otherChain mail, a type of armor consisting of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh.Door chain, a type of security chain on a door that makes it possible to open a door from the inside while still making it difficult for someone outside to force their way insideGang transport chain, a chain used to shackle two or more inmates together for transport or work outside the facility, forming a chain gangLeg iron chains (fetters), an alternative to handcuffsPrisoner transport restraints, a combination which consists of a pair of handcuffs attached by a longer chain to a pair of leg ironsOn chain-linked handcuffs, the cuffs are held together by a short chainAnchor cable, as used by ships and boats; in British nautical usage the component is a cable, the material is chainChain slingsChain hoist , device used for lifting or lowering a loadChain boat, a type of river craft that used a steel chain laid along the riverbed for its propulsionChain-linked lewis, a self-locking lifting device particularly for stone using a chain link as a pivotCurb chain, used on curb bits when riding a horseHigh-tensile chain (or transport chain), chain with a high tensile strength used for towing or securing loadsJack chain, a toothed chain used to move logsLead shank (or stud chain), used on horses that are misbehavingPull switch, an electrical switch operated by a ball chainLavatory chain, the chain attached to the cistern of an old-fashioned W.C. in which the flushing power is obtained by a gravity feed from above-head height. Although most cisterns no longer work like that, the phrase "pull the chain" is still encountered to mean "flush the toilet".Rigid chain actuator, a type of chain that only bends in one direction, allowing it to operate under compressionSnow chains, used to improve traction in snowChain gun, type of machine gun that is driven by an external power source, sometimes connected by a chain, to actuate the mechanism rather than using recoilChain shot, a type of ammunition for a cannon, used to inflict damage to the rigging of a sail vessel in naval warfareChain weapon, a medieval weapon made of one or more weights attached to a handle with a chainChains are a common component of the deflection assembly of disc golf baskets.Chains can be used as a percussion instrument for special effects, such as in Arnold Schönberg's Gurre-Lieder and Leoš Janáček's From the House of the Dead.Keychain, a small chain that connects a small item to a keyringChain sinnet, a method of shortening a rope or other cable while in use or for storageChain stitch, a sewing and embroidery techniqueBall chain, type of chain consisting of small sheet metal balls connected via short lengths of wireCalibrated chain, a type chain where the link lengths are within a given tolerance, so that it reliably engages with a windlass.Flat chain, form of chain used chiefly in agricultural machineryLadder chain, a light wire chain used with sprockets for low torque power transmissionLong link chainO-ring chain, a specialized type of roller chainRoller chain, the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorcycles, and in industrial and agricultural machinerySelf-lubricating chain, type of chain that uses a bush to continually lubricate the chainSilent chain, a type of chain in which the links engage the sprockets similarly to gear teethStud link chain, a type of chain with metal between the sides of each link, keeping the attached links in place. This helps prevent bunching when the chain is run out from a storage bin, as for use in anchoring ships.Short link chain, a chain where the gap between attached links is small relative to thickness.Several methods are available to connect chain ends to each other or to other objects, and to apply a load to a chain away from the ends. These methods are usually specific to the type of chain, and must be of the correct size.The metal link chain has been in use since at least 225 BC.[1]The prevalent modern symbolism is oppression,[] due to the use for a mechanical restriction of the liberty of a human or animal.Chains can also symbolize interconnectivity or interdependence. Unicode, in versions 6.x, contains the   , which may show chain link(s). It may also denote a hyperlink.National Association of Chain Manufacturers, NACM WELDED STEEL CHAIN SPECIFICATIONSChain Spec Basics, Grades and Links Explained. Encyclopædia Britannica.
