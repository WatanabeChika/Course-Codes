irreflexiveIn mathematics, a binary relation R on a set X is reflexive if it relates every element of X to itself.[1][2]An example of a reflexive relation is the relation "is equal to" on the set of real numbers, since every real number is equal to itself.  A reflexive relation is said to have the reflexive property or is said to possess reflexivity.  Along with symmetry and transitivity, reflexivity is one of three properties defining equivalence relations.Let  be a binary relation on a set  which by definition is just a subset of  For any  the notation  means that  while "not " means that The relation  is called reflexive if  for every  or equivalently, if  where  denotes the identity relation on  The reflexive closure of  is the union  which can equivalently be defined as the smallest (with respect to ) reflexive relation on  that is a superset of  A relation  is reflexive if and only if it is equal to its reflexive closure. The reflexive reduction or irreflexive kernel of  is the smallest (with respect to ) relation on  that has the same reflexive closure as  It is equal to  The irreflexive kernel of  can, in a sense, be seen as a construction that is the "opposite" of the reflexive closure of  For example, the reflexive closure of the canonical strict inequality  on the reals  is the usual non-strict inequality  whereas the reflexive reduction of  is There are several definitions related to the reflexive property. The relation  is called:,  or [3]If it does not relate any element to itself; that is, if not  for every  A relation is irreflexive if and only if its complement in  is reflexive. An asymmetric relation is necessarily irreflexive. A transitive and irreflexive relation is necessarily asymmetric.If whenever  are such that  then necessarily [4]If whenever  are such that  then necessarily If every element that is part of some relation is related to itself. Explicitly, this means that whenever  are such that  then necessarily  and  Equivalently, a binary relation is quasi-reflexive if and only if it is both left quasi-reflexive and right quasi-reflexive. A relation  is quasi-reflexive if and only if its symmetric closure  is left (or right) quasi-reflexive.AntisymmetricIf whenever  are such that  then necessarily If whenever  are such that  then necessarily [5] A relation  is coreflexive if and only if its symmetric closure is anti-symmetric.A reflexive relation on a nonempty set  can neither be irreflexive, nor asymmetric ( is called asymmetric if  implies not ), nor antitransitive ( is antitransitive if  implies not ).Examples of reflexive relations include:"is equal to" (equality)"is a subset of" (set inclusion)"divides" (divisibility)"is greater than or equal to""is less than or equal to"Examples of irreflexive relations include:"is not equal to""is coprime to" on the integers larger than 1"is a proper subset of""is greater than""is less than"An example of an irreflexive relation, which means that it does not relate any element to itself, is the "greater than" relation () on the real numbers. Not every relation which is not reflexive is irreflexive; it is possible to define relations where some elements are related to themselves but others are not (that is, neither all nor none are). For example, the binary relation "the product of  and  is even" is reflexive on the set of even numbers, irreflexive on the set of odd numbers, and neither reflexive nor irreflexive on the set of natural numbers. An example of a quasi-reflexive relation  is "has the same limit as" on the set of sequences of real numbers: not every sequence has a limit, and thus the relation is not reflexive, but if a sequence has the same limit as some sequence, then it has the same limit as itself. An example of a left quasi-reflexive relation is a left Euclidean relation, which is always left quasi-reflexive but not necessarily right quasi-reflexive, and thus not necessarily quasi-reflexive. An example of a coreflexive relation is the relation on integers in which each odd number is related to itself and there are no other relations. The equality relation is the only example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation, and any coreflexive relation is a subset of the identity relation. The union of a coreflexive relation and a transitive relation on the same set is always transitive.
