<p><b>Divide and rule</b> policy (Latin: <i lang="la">divide et impera</i>), or <b>divide and conquer</b>, in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power divisively. Historically, this strategy was used in many different ways by empires seeking to expand their territories. However, it has been hard to distinguish between the exploitation of pre-existing divisions by opponents, and the deliberate creation or strengthening of these divisions implied by "divide and rule". 
</p><p>The strategy, but not the phrase, applies in many ancient cases: the example of Aulus Gabinius exists, parting the Jewish nation into five conventions, reported by Flavius Josephus in Book I, 169–170 of <i>The Jewish War</i> (<i>De bello Judaico</i>).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</sup> Strabo also reports in <i>Geographica</i>, 8.7.3<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</sup> that the Achaean League was gradually dissolved when it became part of the Roman province of Macedonia, as the Romans treated the various states differently, wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)">citation needed</span></i>]</sup>
</p><p>Elements of this technique involve:
</p>
<ul><li>creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign and distributing forces that they overpower the other.</li>
<li>aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign</li>
<li>fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers</li>
<li>encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses_of_the_phrase">Uses of the phrase</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>
<p>The use of this technique is meant to empower the sovereign to control subjects, populations, or factions of different interests, who collectively might be able to oppose its rule. Niccolò Machiavelli identifies a similar application to military strategy, advising in Book VI of <i>The Art of War</i> (1521).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</sup> (<i>L'arte della guerra</i>):<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</sup>  a Captain should endeavor with every act to divide the forces of the enemy. Machiavelli advises that this act should be achieved either by making him suspicious of his men in whom he trusted, or by giving him cause that he has to separate his forces, and, because of this, become weaker.
</p><p>The maxim <i><b>divide et impera</b></i> has been attributed to Philip II of Macedon.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2021)">citation needed</span></i>]</sup>  It was utilised by the Roman ruler Julius Caesar<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2021)">citation needed</span></i>]</sup> and the French emperor Napoleon (together with the maxim <i>divide ut regnes)</i>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2021)">citation needed</span></i>]</sup>
</p><p>The strategy of division and rule has been attributed to sovereigns, ranging from Louis XI of France to the House of Habsburg. Edward Coke denounces it in Chapter I of the Fourth Part of the <i>Institutes of the Lawes of England</i>, reporting that when it was demanded by the Lords and Commons what might be a principal motive for them to have good success in Parliament, it was answered: "<i>Eritis insuperabiles, si fueritis inseparabiles. Explosum est illud diverbium: Divide, &amp; impera, cum radix &amp; vertex imperii in obedientium consensu rata sunt.</i>" [You would be invincible if you were inseparable. This proverb, Divide and rule, has been rejected, since the root and the summit of authority are confirmed by the consent of the subjects.]  In a minor variation, Sir Francis Bacon wrote the phrase "separa et impera" in a letter to James I of 15 February 1615. James Madison made this recommendation in a letter to Thomas Jefferson of 24 October 1787,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</sup> which summarized the thesis of <i>The Federalist#10</i>:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</sup> "Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain (some) qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles." In <i>Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch</i>
by Immanuel Kant (1795), Appendix one, <i>Divide et impera</i> is the third of three political maxims, the others being <i>Fac et excusa</i> (Act now, and make excuses later) and <i>Si fecisti, nega</i> (If you commit a crime, deny it).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</sup>
</p><p>Immanuel Kant refers this tactic in the Appendix I of his Perpetual Peace when describing the traits of a <i>political moralist.</i>
</p><p>In economics, the concept is also mentioned as a strategy for market segmentation to get the most out of the players in a competitive market.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</sup>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Foreign_policy">Foreign policy</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>
<p>Divide and rule can be used by states to weaken enemy military alliances. This usually happens when propaganda is disseminated within the enemy states in an attempt to raise doubts about the alliance. Once the alliance weakens or dissolves, a vacuum will allow the state to achieve military dominance.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics">Politics</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>
<p>In politics, the concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people to prevent a rebellion against the elites or the people implementing the strategy. The goal is either to pit the lower classes against themselves to prevent a revolution, or to provide a desired solution to the growing discord that strengthens the power of the elites.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Ilia_Xypolia_2016._P._9_9-0">[9]</sup>
</p><p>The principle "<i>divide et impera</i>" is cited as a common in politics by Traiano Boccalini in <i>La bilancia politica</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</sup>

No doubt even before 1857, there were differences between Hindus and Muslims, the Hindus going to temples and the Muslims going to mosques, but there was no animosity. In fact, the Hindus and Muslims used to help each other; Hindus used to participate in Eid celebrations, and Muslims in Holi and Diwali. The Muslim rulers like the Mughals, Nawab of Awadh and Murshidabad, Tipu Sultan, etc were totally secular; they organised Ramlilas, participated in Holi, Diwali, etc. Ghalib's affectionate letters to his Hindu friends like Munshi Shiv Naraln Aram, Har Gopal Tofta, etc attest to the affection between Hindus and Muslims at that time. In 1857, the ‘Great Mutiny’ broke out in which the Hindus and Muslims jointly fought against the British. This shocked the British government so much that after suppressing the Mutiny, they decided to start the policy of divide and rule (see online “History in the Service of Imperialism” by B.N. Pande). All communal riots began after 1857, artificially engineered by the British authorities. The British collector would secretly call the Hindu Pandit, pay him money, and tell him to speak against Muslims, and similarly he would secretly call the Maulvi, pay him money, and tell him to speak against Hindus. This communal poison was injected into our body politic year after year and decade after decade.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Katju2013_15-1">[15]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand the Hindutva movement, allied to recent Indian governments, stresses strongly Hindu-Muslim conflict going back centuries before the arrival of the British. 
Likewise Historian John Keay takes a contrary position regarding British policy, writing:
</p>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r996844942" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>Stock accusations of a wider Machiavellian intent to ‘divide and rule’ and to ‘stir up Hindu-Muslim animosity’ assume some premonition of a later partition. They make little sense in the contemporary context. ‘Divide and rule’ as a governing precept supposes the pre-existence of an integrated entity. In an India politically united only by British rule – and not yet even by the opposition which it generated – such a thing did not exist. Division was a fact of life. As Maulana Muhammad Ali would later put it, ‘we divide and you rule’. Without recognising, exploring and accommodating such division, British dominion in India would have been impossible to establish, let alone sustain. Provoking sectarian conflict, on the other hand, was rarely in British interest.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, General S.K. Sinha, former Vice-Chief of Army Staff, writes that contrary to what the notion of divide and rule would predict, the Indian Army was effectively integrated:
</p>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r996844942" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>The undivided army was a unique institution set up by the British in India... [A]ll combat units, except Ghorkas and Gharwalis, had a mixed combination of Muslims and non-Muslims. They fought wars together and lived as friendly comrades in peace, owing loyalty to their regiments. Political developments with the emergency of the Congress and the Muslim League did not affect them. The Indian Army was totally apolitical till June 3rd 1947... In fact, during the Partition holocaust and till that date, both Muslim and non-Muslim soldiers remained totally impartial in dealing with communal violence. After June 3, 1947 things started changing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Some analysts assert that the United States is practicing the strategy in the 21st-century Middle East through their supposed escalation of the Sunni–Shia conflict.
