Master_theoremIn mathematics, a theorem that covers a variety of cases is sometimes called  a master theorem.Some theorems called master theorems in their fields include:Master theorem (analysis of algorithms), analyzing the asymptotic behavior of divide-and-conquer algorithmsRamanujan's master theorem, providing an analytic expression for the Mellin transform of an analytic functionMacMahon master theorem (MMT), in enumerative combinatorics and linear algebraGlasser's master theorem in integral calculus
