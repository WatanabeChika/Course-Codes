In the Greek numeric system/isopsephy (gematria), it has a value of 800. The word literally means "great O" (ō mega, mega meaning "great"), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (o mikron, micron meaning "little").[3]In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω represented a long open-mid back rounded vowel IPA: , comparable to the "aw" of the English word raw in dialects without the cot–caught merger, in contrast to omicron which represented the close-mid back rounded vowel IPA:  , and the digraph ου which represented the long close-mid back rounded vowel IPA: . In Modern Greek, both omega and omicron represent the mid back rounded vowel IPA:  or IPA: . The letter omega is transliterated into a Latin-script alphabet as ō or simply o.As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see Alpha and Omega.Ω was not part of the early (8th century BC) Greek alphabets. It was introduced in the late 7th century BC in the Ionian cities of Asia Minor to denote a long open-mid back rounded vowel . It is a variant of omicron (Ο), broken up at the side (), with the edges subsequently turned outward (, , , ).[4]The Dorian city of Knidos as well as a few Aegean islands, namely Paros, Thasos and Melos, chose the exact opposite innovation, using a broken-up circle for the short and a closed circle for the long .[4]The name Ωμέγα is Byzantine; in Classical Greek, the letter was called ō () (pronounced /ɔ̂ː/), whereas the omicron was called ou () (pronounced /ôː/).[5] The modern lowercase shape goes back to the uncial form , a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter () that had its edges curved even further upward.[6]In addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet. See Cyrillic omega (Ѡ, ѡ). A Raetic variant is conjectured to be at the origin or parallel evolution of the Elder Futhark ᛟ.Omega was also adopted into the Latin alphabet, as a letter of the 1982 revision to the African reference alphabet. It has had little use. See Latin omega.The uppercase letter Ω is used as a symbol:In chemistry:For oxygen-18, a natural, stable isotope of oxygen.[7]In physics:For ohm – SI unit of electrical resistance; formerly also used upside down (℧) to represent mho, the old name for the inverse of an ohm (now siemens with symbol S) used for electrical conductance. Unicode has a separate code point for the ohm sign (U+2126, Ω), but it is included only for backward compatibility, and the Greek uppercase omega character (U+03A9, Ω) is preferred.[8]In statistical mechanics, Ω refers to the multiplicity (number of microstates) in a system.The solid angle or the rate of precession in a gyroscope.In particle physics to represent the Omega baryons.In astronomy (cosmology), Ω refers to the density of the universe, also called the density parameter.In astronomy (orbital mechanics), Ω refers to the longitude of the ascending node of an orbit.In mathematics and computer science:In complex analysis, the Omega constant, a solution of Lambert's W functionIn differential geometry, the space of differential forms on a manifold (of a certain degree, usually with a superscript).A variable for a 2-dimensional region in calculus, usually corresponding to the domain of a double integral.In topos theory, the (codomain of the) subobject classifier of an elementary topos.In combinatory logic, the looping combinator, (S I I (S I I))In group theory, the omega and agemo subgroups of a p-group, Ω(G) and ℧(G)In group theory, Cayley's Ω process as a partial differential operator.In statistics, it is used as the symbol for the sample space, or total set of possible outcomes.In number theory, Ω(n) is the number of prime divisors of n (counting multiplicity).[9]In notation related to Big O notation to describe the asymptotic behavior of functions.Chaitin's constant.In set theory, the first infinite ordinal number, ωIn set theory, the first uncountable ordinal number, ω1 or ΩAs part of logo or trademark:The logo of Omega Watches SA.The logo of OmegaklinikkenPart of the original Pioneer logo.Part of the Badge of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.Part of the mission patch for STS-135, as it was the last mission of the Space Shuttle program.The logo of the God of War video game series based on Greek mythology.
