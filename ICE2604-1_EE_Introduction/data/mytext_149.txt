The term refers to a conceptual, not a practical, technique where the number of possibilities is enormous.Newell, Shaw, and Simon[1] called this procedure the British Museum algorithm "... since it seemed to them as sensible as placing monkeys in front of typewriters in order to reproduce all the books in the British Museum."BogosortBranch and boundBreadth-first searchBrute-force search This article incorporates public domain material from Paul E.
