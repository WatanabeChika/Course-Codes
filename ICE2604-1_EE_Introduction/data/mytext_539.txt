kth_order_Fibonacci_numbersIn mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence defined recursively by:That is, after two starting values, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.The Fibonacci sequence has been studied extensively and generalized in many ways, for example, by starting with other numbers than 0 and 1, by adding more than two numbers to generate the next number, or by adding objects other than numbers.Using , one can extend the Fibonacci numbers to negative integers. So we get:... −8, 5, −3, 2, −1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...and .[1]See also NegaFibonacci coding.There are a number of possible generalizations of the Fibonacci numbers which include the real numbers (and sometimes the complex numbers) in their domain.  These each involve the golden ratio , and are based on Binet's formulaThe analytic functionhas the property that  for even integers .[2] Similarly, the analytic function:satisfies  for odd integers .Finally, putting these together, the analytic functionsatisfies  for all integers .[3]Since  for all complex numbers , this function also provides an extension of the Fibonacci sequence to the entire complex plane. Hence we can calculate the generalized Fibonacci function of a complex variable, for example, The term Fibonacci sequence is also applied more generally to any function  from the integers to a field for which .  These functions are precisely those of the form , so the Fibonacci sequences form a vector space with the functions  and  as a basis.More generally, the range of  may be taken to be any abelian group (regarded as a -module). Then the Fibonacci sequences form a 2-dimensional -module in the same way.The 2-dimensional -module of Fibonacci integer sequences consists of all integer sequences satisfying .  Expressed in terms of two initial values we have: where  is the golden ratio.The ratio between two consecutive elements converges to the golden ratio, except in the case of the sequence which is constantly zero and the sequences where the ratio of the two first terms is .The sequence can be written in the formin which  if and only if .  In this form the simplest non-trivial example has , which is the sequence of Lucas numbers:We have  and .  The properties include:Every nontrivial Fibonacci integer sequence appears (possibly after a shift by a finite number of positions) as one of the rows of the Wythoff array. The Fibonacci sequence itself is the first row, and a shift of the Lucas sequence is the second row.[4]See also Fibonacci integer sequences modulo .A different generalization of the Fibonacci sequence is the Lucas sequences of the kind defined as follows:,where the normal Fibonacci sequence is the special case of  and .  Another kind of Lucas sequence begins with , . Such sequences have applications in number theory and primality proving.When , this sequence is called -Fibonacci sequence, for example, Pell sequence is also called 2-Fibonacci sequence.The 3-Fibonacci sequence is0, 1, 3, 10, 33, 109, 360, 1189, 3927, 12970, 42837, 141481, 467280, 1543321, 5097243, 16835050, 55602393, 183642229, 606529080, ...

(sequence  in the OEIS)A Fibonacci sequence of order  is an integer sequence in which each sequence element is the sum of the previous  elements (with the exception of the first  elements in the sequence). The usual Fibonacci numbers are a Fibonacci sequence of order 2. The cases  and  have been thoroughly investigated. The number of compositions of nonnegative integers into parts that are at most  is a Fibonacci sequence of order . The sequence of the number of strings of 0s and 1s of length  that contain at most  consecutive 0s is also a Fibonacci sequence of order .These sequences, their limiting ratios, and the limit of these limiting ratios, were investigated by Mark Barr in 1913.[5]The tribonacci numbers are like the Fibonacci numbers, but instead of starting with two predetermined terms, the sequence starts with three predetermined terms and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding three terms. The first few tribonacci numbers are:0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149, 274, 504, 927, 1705, 3136, 5768, 10609, 19513, 35890, 66012, … (sequence  in the OEIS)The series was first described formally by Agronomof in 1914,[6] but its first unintentional use is in the Origin of Species by Charles R. Darwin. In the example of illustrating the growth of elephant population, he relied on the calculations made by his son, George H. Darwin.[7] The term tribonacci was suggested by Feinberg in 1963.[8]The tribonacci constant (sequence  in the OEIS)is the ratio toward which adjacent tribonacci numbers tend.  It is a root of the polynomial , and also satisfies the equation .  It is important in the study of the snub cube.The reciprocal of the tribonacci constant, expressed by the relation , can be written as: (sequence  in the OEIS)The tribonacci numbers are also given by[9]where  denotes the nearest integer function andThe tetranacci numbers start with four predetermined terms, each term afterwards being the sum of the preceding four terms. The first few tetranacci numbers are:0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 29, 56, 108, 208, 401, 773, 1490, 2872, 5536, 10671, 20569, 39648, 76424, 147312, 283953, 547337, … (sequence  in the OEIS)The tetranacci constant is the ratio toward which adjacent tetranacci numbers tend.  It is a root of the polynomial , approximately 1.927561975482925 (sequence  in the OEIS), and also satisfies the equation .The tetranacci constant can be expressed in terms of radicals by the following expression:[10]where, and  is the real root of the cubic equation Pentanacci, hexanacci, heptanacci, octanacci and enneanacci numbers have been computed. The pentanacci numbers are:0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 61, 120, 236, 464, 912, 1793, 3525, 6930, 13624, … (sequence  in the OEIS)Hexanacci numbers:0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 63, 125, 248, 492, 976, 1936, 3840, 7617, 15109, … (sequence  in the OEIS)Heptanacci numbers:0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127, 253, 504, 1004, 2000, 3984, 7936, 15808, … (sequence  in the OEIS)Octanacci numbers:0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 255, 509, 1016, 2028, 4048, 8080, 16128, ...

(sequence  in the OEIS)The limit of the ratio of successive terms of an -nacci series tends to a root of the equation  (, , ).An alternate recursive formula for the limit of ratio  of two consecutive -nacci numbers can be expressed as.The special case  is the traditional Fibonacci series yielding the golden section .The above formulas for the ratio hold even for -nacci series generated from arbitrary numbers. The limit of this ratio is 2 as  increases.  An "infinacci" sequence, if one could be described, would after an infinite number of zeroes yield the sequence [..., 0, 0, 1,] 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, …which are simply the powers of two.The limit of the ratio for any  is the positive root  of the characteristic equation[10]The root  is in the interval . The negative root of the characteristic equation is in the interval (−1, 0) when  is even. This root and each complex root of the characteristic equation has modulus .[10]A series for the positive root  for any  is[10]There is no solution of the characteristic equation in terms of radicals when .[10]The th element of the -nacci sequence is given bywhere  denotes the nearest integer function and  is the -nacci constant, which is the root of  nearest to 2.A coin-tossing problem is related to the -nacci sequence. The probability that no  consecutive tails will occur in  tosses of an idealized coin is .[11]In analogy to its numerical counterpart, the Fibonacci word is defined by:where  denotes the concatenation of two strings. The sequence of Fibonacci strings starts:b, a, ab, aba, abaab, abaababa, abaababaabaab, … (sequence  in the OEIS)The length of each Fibonacci string is a Fibonacci number, and similarly there exists a corresponding Fibonacci string for each Fibonacci number.Fibonacci strings appear as inputs for the worst case in some computer algorithms.If "a" and "b" represent two different materials or atomic bond lengths, the structure corresponding to a Fibonacci string is a Fibonacci quasicrystal, an aperiodic quasicrystal structure with unusual spectral properties.A convolved Fibonacci sequence is obtained applying a convolution operation to the Fibonacci sequence one or more times. Specifically, define[12]andThe first few sequences are: 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 38, 71, … (sequence  in the OEIS).: 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 9, 22, 51, 111, … (sequence  in the OEIS).: 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 14, 40, 105, … (sequence  in the OEIS).The sequences can be calculated using the recurrenceThe generating function of the th convolution is The sequences are related to the sequence of Fibonacci polynomials by the relationwhere  is the th derivative of . Equivalently,  is the coefficient of  when  is expanded in powers of .The first convolution,  can be written in terms of the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers asand follows the recurrenceSimilar expressions can be found for  with increasing complexity as  increases. The numbers  are the row sums of Hosoya's triangle.As with Fibonacci numbers, there are several combinatorial interpretations of these sequences. For example  is the number of ways  can be written as an ordered sum involving only 0, 1, and 2 with 0 used exactly once. In particular  and 2 can be written , , , , .[13]The Fibonacci polynomials are another generalization of Fibonacci numbers.The Padovan sequence is generated by the recurrence .The Narayana's cows sequence is generated by the recurrence .A random Fibonacci sequence can be defined by tossing a coin for each position  of the sequence and taking  if it lands heads and  if it lands tails.  Work by Furstenberg and Kesten guarantees that this sequence almost surely grows exponentially at a constant rate: the constant is independent of the coin tosses and was computed in 1999 by Divakar Viswanath.  It is now known as Viswanath's constant.A repfigit, or Keith number, is an integer such that, when its digits start a Fibonacci sequence with that number of digits, the original number is eventually reached.  An example is 47, because the Fibonacci sequence starting with 4 and 7  reaches 47.  A repfigit can be a tribonacci sequence if there are 3 digits in the number, a tetranacci number if the number has four digits, etc. The first few repfigits are:14, 19, 28, 47, 61, 75, 197, 742, 1104, 1537, 2208, 2580, 3684, 4788, 7385, 7647, 7909, … (sequence  in the OEIS)Since the set of sequences satisfying the relation  is closed under termwise addition and under termwise multiplication by a constant, it can be viewed as a vector space.  Any such sequence is uniquely determined by a choice of two elements, so the vector space is two-dimensional.  If we abbreviate such a sequence as , the Fibonacci sequence  and the shifted Fibonacci sequence  are seen to form a canonical basis for this space, yielding the identity:for all such sequences .  For example, if  is the Lucas sequence , then we obtain.-generated Fibonacci sequenceWe can define the -generated Fibonacci sequence (where  is a positive rational number): ifwhere  is the th prime, then we defineIf , then , and if , then .[]SequenceOEIS sequenceFibonacci sequence6A000045Pell sequence12A000129Jacobsthal sequence18A001045Tribonacci sequence30A000073Tetranacci sequence210A000288Padovan sequence15A000931Narayana's cows sequence10A000930The semi-Fibonacci sequence (sequence  in the OEIS) is defined via the same recursion for odd-indexed terms  and , but for even indices , .
