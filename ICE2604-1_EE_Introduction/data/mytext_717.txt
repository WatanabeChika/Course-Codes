Its name in English is pee (pronounced /), plural pees.[1]The Semitic Pê (mouth), as well as the Greek Π or π (Pi), and the Etruscan and Latin letters that developed from the former alphabet, all symbolized , a voiceless bilabial plosive.EgyptianProto-SinaiticProto-CanaanitepʿitPhoenician peArchaic Greek  PiGreek  PiEtruscan  PLatin PIn English orthography and most other European languages, ⟨p⟩ represents the sound .A common digraph in English is ⟨ph⟩, which represents the sound /, and can be used to transliterate ⟨φ⟩ phi in loanwords from Greek. In German, the digraph ⟨pf⟩ is common, representing a labial affricate .Most English words beginning with ⟨p⟩ are of foreign origin, primarily French, Latin and Greek; these languages preserve Proto-Indo-European initial *p.    Native English cognates of such words often start with ⟨f⟩, since English is a Germanic language and thus has undergone Grimm's law; a native English word with initial  would reflect Proto-Indo-European initial *b, which is so rare that its existence as a phoneme is disputed.However, native English words with non-initial ⟨p⟩ are quite common; such words can come from either Kluge's law or the consonant cluster  (PIE *p has been preserved after s).In the International Phonetic Alphabet,  is used to represent the voiceless bilabial plosive.A bold italic letter  is used in musical notation as a dynamic indicator for "quiet". It stands for the Italian word piano.[2][3]The Latin letter P represents the same sound as the Greek letter Pi, but it looks like the Greek letter Rho.𐤐 : Semitic letter Pe, from which the following symbols originally deriveΠ π : Greek letter Pi𐌐 : Old Italic and Old Latin P, which derives from Greek Pi, and is the ancestor of modern Latin P.
