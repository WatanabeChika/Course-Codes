multi-commodity_flowThe multi-commodity flow problem is a network flow problem with multiple commodities (flow demands) between different source and sink nodes.Given a flow network , where edge  has capacity . There are  commodities , defined by , where  and  is the source and sink of commodity , and  is its demand. The variable  defines the fraction of flow  along edge , where  in case the flow can be split among multiple paths, and  otherwise (i.e. "single path routing"). Find an assignment of all flow variables which satisfies the following four constraints:(1) Link capacity: The sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity.(2) Flow conservation on transit nodes: The amount of a flow entering an intermediate node  is the same that exits the node.(3) Flow conservation at the source: A flow must exit its source node completely.(4) Flow conservation at the destination: A flow must enter its sink node completely.Load balancing is the attempt to route flows such that the utilization  of all links  is even, whereThe problem can be solved e.g. by minimizing . A common linearization of this problem is the minimization of the maximum utilization , whereIn the minimum cost multi-commodity flow problem, there is a cost  for sending a flow on . You then need to minimize In the maximum multi-commodity flow problem, the demand of each commodity is not fixed, and the total throughput is maximized by maximizing the sum of all demands The minimum cost variant of the multi-commodity flow problem is a generalization of the minimum cost flow problem (in which there is merely one source  and one sink . Variants of the circulation problem are generalizations of all flow problems. That is, any flow problem can be viewed as a particular circulation problem.[1]Routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) in optical burst switching of Optical Network would be approached via multi-commodity flow formulas.In the decision version of problems, the problem of producing an integer flow satisfying all demands is NP-complete,[2] even for only two commodities and unit capacities (making the problem strongly NP-complete in this case). If fractional flows are allowed, the problem can be solved in polynomial time through linear programming,[3] or through (typically much faster) fully polynomial time approximation schemes.[4]Multicommodify flow is applied in the overlay routing in content delivery.
