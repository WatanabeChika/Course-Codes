<p>A <b>pagoda</b> is an Asian tiered tower with multiple eaves common to Nepal, India, China, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam,  and other parts of Asia. Most pagodas were built to have a religious function, most often Buddhist but sometimes Taoist, and were often located in or near viharas. The pagoda traces its origins to the stupa of ancient India.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-The_Origin_of_Pagodas_1-0">[1]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Ency_3-0">[3]</sup>
</p><p>Chinese pagodas (Chinese: <span lang="zh">塔</span>; pinyin: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Tǎ</span></i>) are a traditional part of Chinese architecture. In addition to religious use, since ancient times Chinese pagodas have been praised for the spectacular views they offer, and many classical poems attest to the joy of scaling pagodas. Chinese sources credit the Nepalese architect Araniko with introducing the pagoda to China.
</p><p>The oldest and tallest pagodas were built of wood, but most that survived were built of brick or stone. Some pagodas are solid with no interior. Hollow pagodas have no higher floors or rooms, but the interior often contains an altar or a smaller pagoda, as well as a series of staircases for the visitor to ascend and to witness the view from an opening on one side of each tier. Most have between three and 13 tiers (almost always an odd number) and the classic gradual tiered eaves.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-steinhardt_387_5-0">[5]</sup>
</p><p>In some countries, the term may refer to other religious structures. In Vietnam and Cambodia, due to French translation, the English term <i>pagoda</i> is a more generic term referring to a place of worship, although <i>pagoda</i> is not an accurate word to describe a Buddhist vihara. The architectural structure of the stupa has spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms specific to each region. Many Philippine bell towers are highly influenced by pagodas through Chinese workers hired by the Spaniards.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>
<p>One proposed etymology is from a South Chinese pronunciation of the term for an eight-cornered tower, Chinese: <span lang="zh">八角塔</span>, and reinforced by the name of a famous pagoda encountered by many early European visitors to China, the "Pázhōu tǎ" (Chinese: <span lang="zh">琶洲塔</span>), standing just south of Guangzhou at Whampoa Anchorage.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</sup> Another proposed etymology is Persian <i>butkada</i>, from <i>but</i>, "idol" and <i>kada</i>, "temple, dwelling."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</sup>
</p><p>Yet another etymology is from the Sinhala word <i>dāgaba</i>, derived from Sanskrit <i>dhātugarbha</i> or Pali <i>dhātugabbha</i>: "relic womb/chamber" or "reliquary shrine", i.e. a stupa, by way of Portuguese.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</sup>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>

<p>The origin of the pagoda can be traced to the stupa (3rd century BCE).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Ency_3-1">[3]</sup> The stupa, a dome shaped monument, was used as a commemorative monument to house sacred relics and writings.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Ency_3-2">[3]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</sup> In East Asia, the architecture of Chinese towers and Chinese pavilions blended into pagoda architecture, eventually also spreading to Southeast Asia. Their construction was popularized by the efforts of Buddhist missionaries, pilgrims, rulers, and ordinary devotees to honor Buddhist relics.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</sup>
</p><p>Japan has a total of 22 five-storied timber pagodas constructed before 1850.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hanazato10_11-0">[11]</sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="China">China</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

<p>The earliest styles of Chinese pagodas were square-base and circular-base, with octagonal-base towers emerging in the 5th–10th centuries. The highest Chinese pagoda from the pre-modern age is the Liaodi Pagoda of Kaiyuan Monastery, Dingxian, Hebei, completed in the year 1055 AD under Emperor Renzong of Song and standing at a total height of 84 m (275 ft). Although it no longer stands, the tallest pre-modern pagoda in Chinese history was the 100-metre-tall wooden pagoda (330 ft) of Chang'an, built by Emperor Yang of Sui,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</sup> and possibly the short-lived 6th century Yongning Pagoda (永宁宝塔) of Luoyang at roughly 137 meter. The tallest pre-modern pagoda still standing is the Liaodi Pagoda. In April 2007 a new wooden pagoda Tianning Temple of Changzhou was opened to the public, the tallest in China, standing 154 m (505 ft).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Symbolism_and_geomancy">Symbolism and geomancy</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>

<p>Chinese iconography is noticeable in Chinese and other East Asian pagoda architectures. Also prominent is Buddhist iconography such as the image of the Shakyamuni and Gautama Buddha in the <i>abhaya mudra.</i><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</sup> In an article on Buddhist elements in Han dynasty art, Wu Hung suggests that in these temples, Buddhist symbolism was fused with native Chinese traditions into a unique system of symbolism.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</sup>
</p><p>Some believed reverence at pagodas could bring luck to students taking the Chinese civil service examinations.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</sup> When a pagoda of Yihuang County in Fuzhou collapsed in 1210, local inhabitants believed the disaster correlated with the recent failure of many exam candidates in the prefectural examinations<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hymes_30_17-0">[17]</sup> The pagoda was rebuilt in 1223 and had a list inscribed on it of the recently successful examination candidates, in hopes that it would reverse the trend and win the county supernatural favor.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hymes_30_17-1">[17]</sup>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Architecture">Architecture</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>

<p>Pagodas come in many different sizes,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</sup> with taller ones often attracting lightning strikes, inspiring a tradition that the finial decoration of the top of the structure can seize demons.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</sup> Today many pagodas have been fitted with wires making the finial into a lightning rod.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</sup>
</p><p>Wooden pagodas possess certain characteristics thought to resist earthquake damage. These include the friction damping and
sliding effect of the complex wooden dougong joints,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-tokmakova17_21-0">[21]</sup> the structural isolation of floors, the effects of wide eaves analogous to a balancing toy, and the Shinbashira phenomenon that the center column is bolted to the rest of the superstructure.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-nakahara00_22-0">[22]</sup>
</p><p>Pagodas traditionally have an odd number of levels, a notable exception being the eighteenth-century orientalist pagoda designed by Sir William Chambers at Kew Gardens in London.
</p><p>The pagodas in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia are derived from Dravidian architecture.
The pagodas in Himalayas are derived from Kath kuni architecture, very different from Chinese and Japanese styles.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wood">Wood</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

<p>During the Southern and Northern Dynasties pagodas were mostly built of wood, as were other ancient Chinese structures.  Wooden pagodas are resistant to earthquakes, and no Japanese pagoda has been destroyed by an earthquake,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-nakahara00_22-1">[22]</sup> but they are prone to fire, natural rot, and insect infestation.
</p><p>Examples of wooden pagodas:
</p>
<ul><li>White Horse Pagoda at White Horse Temple, Luoyang.</li>
<li>Futuci Pagoda in Xuzhou, built in the Three Kingdoms period (c. 220–265).</li>
<li>Many of the pagodas in <i>Stories About Buddhist Temples in Luoyang</i>, a Northern Wei text.</li></ul>
<p>The literature of subsequent eras also provides evidence of the domination of wooden pagoda construction.  The famous Tang dynasty poet, Du Mu, once wrote:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>480 Buddhist temples of the Southern Dynasties,</i></dd>
<dd><i>uncountable towers and pagodas stand in the misty rain.</i></dd></dl>
<p>The oldest standing fully wooden pagoda in China today is the Pagoda of Fugong Temple in Ying County, Shanxi, built in the 11th century during the Song/Liao dynasty (see Song Architecture).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transition_to_brick_and_stone">Transition to brick and stone</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

<p>During the Northern Wei and Sui dynasties (386–618) experiments began with the construction of brick and stone pagodas.  Even at the end of the Sui, however, wood was still the most common material.  For example, Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty (reigned 581–604) once issued a decree for all counties and prefectures to build pagodas to a set of standard designs, however since they were all built of wood none have survived. Only the Songyue Pagoda has survived, a circular-based pagoda built out of stone in 523 AD.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Brick">Brick</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>The earliest extant brick pagoda is the 40-metre-tall Songyue Pagoda in Dengfeng Country, Henan.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-steinhardt_383_24-0">[24]</sup> This curved, circle-based pagoda was built in 523 during the Northern Wei Dynasty, and has survived for 15 centuries.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-steinhardt_383_24-1">[24]</sup> Much like the later pagodas found during the following Tang Dynasty, this temple featured tiers of eaves encircling its frame, as well as a spire crowning the top. Its walls are 2.5 m thick, with a ground floor diameter of 10.6 m. Another early brick pagoda is the Sui dynasty Guoqing Pagoda built in 597.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Stone">Stone</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>The earliest large-scale stone pagoda is a Four Gates Pagoda at Licheng, Shandong, built in 611 during the Sui dynasty. Like the Songyue Pagoda, it also features a spire at its top, and is built in the pavilion style.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Brick_and_stone">Brick and stone</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>One of the earliest brick and stone pagodas was a three-storey construction built in the (first) Jin Dynasty (266–420), by Wang Jun of Xiangyang.  However, it is now destroyed.
</p><p>Brick and stone went on to dominate Tang, Song, Liao and Jin Dynasty pagoda construction. An example is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (652 AD), built during the early Tang Dynasty. The Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing has been one of the most famous brick and stone pagoda in China throughout history.
The Zhou dynasty started making the ancient pagodas about 3,500 years ago.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="De-emphasis_over_time">De-emphasis over time</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>

<p>Pagodas, in keeping with the tradition of the White Horse Temple, were generally placed in the center of temples until the Sui and Tang dynasties.  During the Tang, the importance of the main hall was elevated and the pagoda was moved beside the hall, or out of the temple compound altogether.  In the early Tang, Daoxuan wrote a <i>Standard Design for Buddhist Temple Construction</i> in which the main hall replaced the pagoda as the center of the temple.
</p><p>The design of temples was also influenced by the use of traditional Chinese residences as shrines, after they were philanthropically donated by the wealthy or the pious.  In such pre-configured spaces, building a central pagoda might not have been either desirable or possible.
</p><p>In the Song dynasty (960–1279), the Chan (Zen) sect developed a new 'seven part structure' for temples.  The seven parts—the Buddha hall, dharma hall, monks' quarters, depository, gate, pure land hall and toilet facilities—completely exclude pagodas, and can be seen to represent the final triumph of the traditional Chinese palace/courtyard system over the original central-pagoda tradition established 1000 years earlier by the White Horse Temple in 67. Although they were built outside of the main temple itself, large pagodas in the tradition of the past were still built. This includes the two Ming dynasty pagodas of Famen Temple and the Chongwen Pagoda in Jingyang of Shaanxi.
</p><p>A prominent, later example of converting a palace to a temple is Beijing's Yonghe Temple, which was the residence of Yongzheng Emperor before he ascended the throne.  It was donated for use as a lamasery after his death in 1735.

<p>Examples of Han Dynasty era tower architecture predating Buddhist influence and the full-fledged Chinese pagoda can be seen in the four pictures below. Michael Loewe writes that during the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) period, multi-storied towers were erected for religious purposes, as astronomical observatories, as watchtowers, or as ornate buildings that were believed to attract the favor of spirits, deities, and immortals.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</sup>
