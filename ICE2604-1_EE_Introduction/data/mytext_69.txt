The assertions are logical statements—predicates with variables, where the variables define the state of the program.Algebraic semantics (computer science) — in terms of algebrasDenotational semantics  — by translation of the program into another languageOperational semantics — in terms of the state of the computationFormal semantics of programming languages — overviewPredicate transformer semantics — describes the meaning of a program fragment as the function transforming a postcondition to the precondition needed to establish it.Assertion (computing)
