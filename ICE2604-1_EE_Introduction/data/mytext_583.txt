Lotka's_lawLotka's law,[1] named after Alfred J. Lotka, is one of a variety of special applications of Zipf's law.  It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. It states that the number of authors making    contributions in a given period is a fraction of the number making a single contribution, following the formula    where  nearly always equals two, i.e., an approximate inverse-square law, where the number of authors publishing a certain number of articles is a fixed ratio to the number of authors publishing a single article.  As the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent.  There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc.  Though the law itself covers many disciplines, the actual ratios involved (as a function of 'a') are discipline-specific.The general formula says:orwhere X is the number of publications, Y the relative frequency of authors with X publications, and n and  are constants depending on the specific field ().Say 100 authors write at least one article each over a specific period. We assume for this table that C=100 and n=2. Then the number of authors writing portions of any particular articles in that time period is described as in the following table:Portion of articles writtenNumber of authors writing that number of articles10100/102 = 19100/92 ≈ 1 (1.23)8100/82 ≈ 2 (1.56)7100/72 ≈ 2 (2.04)6100/62 ≈ 3 (2.77)5100/52 = 44100/42 ≈ 6 (6.25)3100/32 ≈ 11 (11.111...)2100/22 = 251100That would be a total of 294 articles with 155 writers with an average of 1.9 articles for each writer.This is an empirical observation rather than a necessary result.  This form of the law is as originally published and is sometimes referred to as the "discrete Lotka power function".[2]Friedman, A. 2015.
