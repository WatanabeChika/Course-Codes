<p><b>Determinism</b> is a philosophical view, where all events are determined completely by previously existing causes. Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have developed from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called nondeterminism) or randomness. Determinism is often contrasted with free will, although some philosophers claim that the two are compatible.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Franklin_1-0">[1]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</sup>
</p><p>Determinism is often used to mean <i>causal determinism</i>, which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. This is the concept that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality in such a way that any state of an object or event is completely determined by its prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.
</p><p>Debates about determinism often concern the scope of determined systems; some maintain that the entire universe is a single determinate system, and others identifying more limited determinate systems (or multiverse). Historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility).
</p><p>Determinism should not be confused with the self-determination of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism is about interactions which affect our cognitive processes in our life.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</sup> It is about the cause and the result of what we have done. Cause and result are always bounded together in cognitive processes. It assumes that if an observer has sufficient information about an object or human being, that such an observer might be able to predict every consequent move of that object or human being. Determinism rarely requires that perfect prediction be practically possible.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Varieties">Varieties</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>
<p>"Determinism" may commonly refer to any of the following viewpoints.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Causal">Causal</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3><p>
Causal determinism, sometimes synonymous with historical determinism (a sort of path dependence), is "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SEPcausaldeterminism_4-0">[4]</sup> However, it is a broad enough term to consider that:<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SEPmoralresponsibility_5-0">[5]</sup></p><blockquote><p>...One's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way.</p></blockquote><p>Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing in the universe that has no cause or is self-caused.
Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-StanfordIncompatibilism_6-0">[6]</sup> In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding eventsâa combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SEPcausaldeterminism_4-1">[4]</sup> Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SEPmoralresponsibility_5-1">[5]</sup></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Nomological"><span class="anchor" id="Nomological_determinism"></span>Nomological</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>Nomological determinism, generally synonymous with physical determinism (its opposite being physical indeterminism), the most common form of causal determinism, is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-laplace_7-0">[7]</sup> Nomological determinism is sometimes called <i>scientific determinism</i>, although that is a misnomer.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Necessitarianism">Necessitarianism</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>Necessitarianism is closely related to the causal determinism described above. It is a metaphysical principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be. Leucippus claimed there were no uncaused events, and that everything occurs for a reason and by necessity.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Predeterminism">Predeterminism</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>Predeterminism is the idea that all events are determined in advance.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-McKewan_9-0">[9]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</sup> The concept is often argued by invoking causal determinism, implying that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain.
</p><p>Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorized as a specific type of determinism.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-McKewan_9-1">[9]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</sup> It can also be used interchangeably with causal determinismâin the context of its capacity to determine future events.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-McKewan_9-2">[9]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</sup> Despite this, predeterminism is often considered as independent of causal determinism.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Society1971_14-0">[14]</sup>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Biological">Biological</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>The term <i>predeterminism</i> is also frequently used in the context of biology and heredity, in which case it represents a form of biological determinism, sometimes called <i>genetic determinism</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</sup> Biological determinism is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.
</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche explained that a human being is "determined" by his/her body, since he/she is subject to passions, impulsions and instincts.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fatalism">Fatalism</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>Fatalism is normally distinguished from "determinism",<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SEPDeterminism_17-0">[17]</sup> as a form of teleological determinism. Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future. Fate has arbitrary power, and need not follow any causal or otherwise deterministic laws.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-StanfordIncompatibilism_6-1">[6]</sup> Types of fatalism include hard theological determinism and the idea of predestination, where there is a God who determines all that humans will do. This may be accomplished either by knowing their actions in advance, via some form of omniscience<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Fischer_18-0">[18]</sup> or by decreeing their actions in advance.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Watt_19-0">[19]</sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Theological_determinism">Theological determinism</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>Theological determinism is a form of determinism that holds that all events that happen are either preordained (i.e., predestined) to happen by a monotheistic deity, or are destined to occur given its omniscience. Two forms of theological determinism exist, referred to as <i>strong</i> and <i>weak</i> theological determinism.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-JordanTate2004_20-0">[20]</sup>
</p><p>Strong theological determinism is based on the concept of a creator deity dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Iannone2001_21-0">[21]</sup>
</p><p>Weak theological determinism is based on the concept of divine foreknowledgeâ"because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Huyssteen2003_22-0">[22]</sup> There exist slight variations on this categorisation, however. Some claim either that theological determinism requires predestination of all events and outcomes by the divinityâi.e., they do not classify the weaker version as <i>theological determinism</i> unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequenceâor that the weaker version does not constitute <i>theological determinism</i> at all.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-VanArragon2010_23-0">[23]</sup>
</p><p>With respect to free will, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-stanfordincompatibilismarguments_24-0">[24]</sup>
</p><p>Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of causal determinism, in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SEPmoralresponsibility_5-2">[5]</sup> Some have asserted that Augustine of Hippo introduced theological determinism into Christianity in 412 CE, whereas all prior Christian authors supported free will against Stoic and Gnostic determinism.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</sup> However, there are many Biblical passages that seem to support the idea of some kind of theological determinism.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adequate_determinism">Adequate determinism</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>Adequate determinism is the idea, because of quantum decoherence, that quantum indeterminacy can be ignored for most macroscopic events. Random quantum events "average out" in the limit of large numbers of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of classical mechanics).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-26">[26]</sup> Stephen Hawking explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of quantum mechanics is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the predictions of classical mechanics, which are quite accurate (albeit still not perfectly certain) at larger scales.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27">[27]</sup> Something as large as an animal cell, then, would be "adequately determined" (even in light of quantum indeterminacy).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2022)">citation needed</span></i>]</sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Many-worlds">Many-worlds</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>The many-worlds interpretation accepts the linear causal sets of sequential events with adequate consistency yet also suggests constant forking of causal chains creating "multiple universes" to account for multiple outcomes from single events.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28">[28]</sup> Meaning the causal set of events leading to the present are all valid yet appear as a singular linear time stream within a much broader unseen conic probability field of other outcomes that "split off" from the locally observed timeline.  Under this model causal sets are still "consistent" yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes.
</p><p>The interpretation sidesteps the exclusive retrospective causal chain problem of "could not have done otherwise" by suggesting "the other outcome does exist" in a set of parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred. This theory is sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that recursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29">[29]</sup> This model is highly contested with multiple objections from the scientific community.

<p>Although some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and cognition, others frame themselves as an answer to the debate on nature and nurture. They will suggest that one factor will entirely determine behavior. As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions of these theories have been widely rejected as a single-cause fallacy.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-melo-martin_30-0">[30]</sup> In other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature <i>and</i> nurture is entirely predictable. The concept of heritability has been helpful in making this distinction.
</p>
<ul><li>Biological determinism, sometimes called <i>genetic determinism</i>, is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.</li>
<li>Behaviorism involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causesâeither environmental or reflexive. John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner developed this nurture-focused determinism.</li>
<li>Cultural materialism, contends that the physical world impacts and sets constraints on human behavior.</li>
<li>Cultural determinism, along with social determinism, is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we are raised determines who we are.</li>
<li>Environmental determinism, also known as <i>climatic</i> or <i>geographical determinism,</i> proposes that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture. Supporters of environmental determinism often<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This term requires quantification. (August 2014)">quantify</span></i>]</sup> also support behavioral determinism. Key proponents of this notion have included Ellen Churchill Semple, Ellsworth Huntington, Thomas Griffith Taylor and possibly Jared Diamond, although his status as an environmental determinist is debated.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-31">[31]</sup></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Determinism_and_prediction">Determinism and prediction</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>

<p>Other 'deterministic'<sup class="noprint Inline-Template noprint Template-Opinion" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This statement may be opinion presented as fact. (December 2022)">opinion</span></i>]</sup> theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect predictions.
</p>
<ul><li>Psychological determinism can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be synonymous with some sort of psychological egoism. The latter is the view that humans will always act according to their perceived best interest.</li>
<li>Linguistic determinism proposes that language determines (or at least limits) the things that humans can think and say and thus know. The SapirâWhorf hypothesis argues that individuals experience the world based on the grammatical structures they habitually use.</li>
<li>Economic determinism attributes primacy to economic structure over politics in the development of human history. It is associated with the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx.</li>
<li>Technological determinism is the theory that a society's technology drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structural_determinism">Structural determinism</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>
<p>Structural determinism is the philosophical view that actions, events, and processes are predicated on and determined by structural factors.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-32">[32]</sup> Given any particular structure or set of estimable components, it is a concept that emphasizes rational and predictable outcomes. Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela popularized the notion, writing that a living system's general order is maintained via a circular process of ongoing self-referral, and thus its organization and structure defines the changes it undergoes.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-33">[33]</sup> According to the authors, a system can undergo changes of state (alteration of structure without loss of identity) or disintegrations (alteration of structure with loss of identity). Such changes or disintegrations are not ascertained by the elements of the disturbing agent, as each disturbance will only trigger responses in the respective system, which in turn, are determined by each systemâs own structure.
</p><p>On an individualistic level, what this means is that human beings as free and independent entities are triggered to react by external stimuli or change in circumstance. However, their own internal state and existing physical and mental capacities determine their responses to those triggers. On a much broader societal level, structural determinists believe that larger issues in the societyâespecially those pertaining to minorities and subjugated communitiesâare predominantly assessed through existing structural conditions, making change of prevailing conditions difficult, and sometimes outright impossible. For example, the concept has been applied to the politics of race in the United States of America and other Western countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, with structural determinists lamenting structural factors for the prevalence of racism in these countries.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-34">[34]</sup> Additionally, Marxists have conceptualized the writings of Karl Marx within the context of structural determinism as well. For example, Louis Althusser, a structural Marxist, argues that the state, in its political, economic, and legal structures, reproduces the discourse of capitalism, in turn, allowing for the burgeoning of capitalistic structures.
</p><p>Proponents of the notion highlight the usefulness of structural determinism to study complicated issues related to race and gender, as it highlights often gilded structural conditions that block meaningful change.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35">[35]</sup> Critics call it too rigid, reductionist and inflexible. Additionally, they also criticize the notion for overemphasizing deterministic forces such as structure over the role of human agency and the ability of the people to act. These critics argue that politicians, academics, and social activists have the capability to bring about significant change despite stringent structural conditions.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="With_free_will">With free will</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/><p>Philosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will. This creates the four possible positions in the figure. Compatibilism refers to the view that free will is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three incompatibilist positions deny this possibility. The hard incompatibilists hold that free will is incompatible with both determinism and indeterminism, the libertarians that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist, and the hard determinists that determinism does hold and free will does not exist. The Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza was a determinist thinker, and argued that human freedom can be achieved through knowledge of the causes that determine our desire and affections. He defined human servitude as the state of bondage of anyone who is aware of their own desires, but ignorant of the causes that determined them. However, the free or virtuous person becomes capable, through reason and knowledge, to be genuinely free, even as they are being "determined". For the Dutch philosopher, acting out of one's own internal necessity is genuine freedom while being driven by exterior determinations is akin to bondage. Spinoza's thoughts on human servitude and liberty are respectively detailed in the fourth<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-36">[36]</sup> and fifth<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-37">[37]</sup> volumes of his work <i>Ethics</i>.
</p><p>The standard argument against free will, according to philosopher J. J. C. Smart, focuses on the implications of determinism for free will.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-38">[38]</sup> He suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. He says that if determinism is true, all actions are predicted and no one is assumed to be free; however, if determinism is false, all actions are presumed to be random and as such no one seems free because they have no part in controlling what happens.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="With_the_soul">With the soul</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>
<p>Some determinists argue that materialism does not present a complete understanding of the universe, because while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, it ignores the minds or souls of conscious beings.
</p><p>A number of positions can be delineated:

<p>Determinism was developed by the Greek philosophers during the 7th and 6th centuries BCE by the Pre-socratic philosophers Heraclitus and Leucippus, later Aristotle, and mainly by the Stoics. Some of the main philosophers who have dealt with this issue are Marcus Aurelius, Omar KhayyÃ¡m, Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, David Hume, Baron d'Holbach (Paul Heinrich Dietrich), Pierre-Simon Laplace, Arthur Schopenhauer, William James, Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Ralph Waldo Emerson and, more recently, John Searle, Ted Honderich, and Daniel Dennett.
</p><p>Mecca Chiesa notes that the probabilistic or selectionistic determinism of B. F. Skinner comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not mechanistic at all. Mechanistic determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-42">[42]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-43">[43]</sup>

<p>Determinism in the West is often associated with Newtonian mechanics/physics, which depicts the physical matter of the universe as operating according to a set of fixed laws. The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of every event that will ever occur (<i>Laplace's demon</i>). In this sense, the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.
</p><p>Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events; for example, if an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been successful. But it fails as velocities become some substantial fraction of the speed of light and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.
</p><p>Newtonian mechanics, as well as any following physical theories, are results of observations and experiments, and so they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in Western philosophy,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-51">[51]</sup> as well as the related theological views of classical pantheism.

<p>The idea that the entire universe is a deterministic system has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religions, philosophy, and literature.
</p><p>The ancient Arabs that inhabited the Arabian Peninsula before the advent of Islam used to profess a widespread belief in fatalism (<i>á¸³adar</i>) alongside a fearful consideration for the sky and the stars as divine beings, which they held to be ultimately responsible for every phenomena that occurs on Earth and for the destiny of humankind.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Al-Abbasi_2020_52-0">[52]</sup> Accordingly, they shaped their entire lives in accordance with their interpretations of astral configurations and phenomena.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Al-Abbasi_2020_52-1">[52]</sup>
</p><p>In the <i>I Ching</i> and philosophical Taoism, the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (<i>see</i>: Wu wei). In the philosophical schools of the Indian Subcontinent, the concept of <i>karma</i> deals with similar philosophical issues to the Western concept of determinism. Karma is understood as a spiritual mechanism which causes the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (<i>saá¹sÄra</i>).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Bodewitz_2019_53-0">[53]</sup> Karma, either positive or negative, accumulates according to an individual's actions throughout their life, and at their death determines the nature of their next life in the cycle of Saá¹sÄra.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Bodewitz_2019_53-1">[53]</sup> Most major religions originating in India hold this belief to some degree, most notably Hinduism,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Bodewitz_2019_53-2">[53]</sup> Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism.
</p><p>The views on the interaction of karma and free will are numerous, and diverge from each other. For example, in Sikhism, god's grace, gained through worship, can erase one's karmic debts, a belief which reconciles the principle of karma with a monotheistic god one must freely choose to worship.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-54">[54]</sup> Jainists believe in compatibilism, in which the cycle of Saá¹sara is a completely mechanistic process, occurring without any divine intervention. The Jains hold an atomic view of reality, in which particles of karma form the fundamental microscopic building material of the universe.

<p>Buddhist philosophy contains several concepts which some scholars<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.

</p><p>One concept which is argued<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (December 2022)">by whom?</span></i>]</sup> to support a hard determinism is the idea of dependent origination, which claims that all phenomena (<i>dharma</i>) are necessarily caused by some other phenomenon, which it can be said to be <i>dependent</i> on, like links in a massive chain. In traditional Buddhist philosophy, this concept is used to explain the functioning of the cycle of <i>saá¹sÄra</i>; all actions exert a karmic force, which will manifest results in future lives. In other words, righteous or unrighteous actions in one life will necessarily cause good or bad responses in another.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-58">[58]</sup>
</p><p>Another Buddhist concept which many scholars perceive to be deterministic is the idea of non-self, or <i>anatta</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-:0_59-0">[59]</sup> In Buddhism, attaining enlightenment involves one realizing that in humans there is no fundamental core of being which can be called the "soul", and that humans are instead made of several constantly changing factors which bind them to the cycle of Saá¹sÄra.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-:0_59-1">[59]</sup>
</p><p>Some scholars argue that the concept of non-self necessarily disproves the ideas of free will and moral culpability. If there is no autonomous self, in this view, and all events are necessarily and unchangeably caused by others, then no type of autonomy can be said to exist, moral or otherwise. However, other scholars disagree, claiming that the Buddhist conception of the universe allows for a form of compatibilism. Buddhism perceives reality occurring on two different levels, the ultimate reality which can only be truly understood by the enlightened, and the illusory and false material reality. Therefore, Buddhism perceives free will as a notion belonging to material reality, while concepts like non-self and dependent origination belong to the ultimate reality; the transition between the two can be truly understood, Buddhists claim, by one who has attained enlightenment.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-60">[60]</sup>

<p>As an illustration, the strategy board-games chess and Go have rigorous rules in which no information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no random events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game. Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, endgame tables are available that dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.  This implies that, given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible.  In this scenario, the winning player can announce that a checkmate will happen within a given number of moves, assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Kenrick_64-2">[64]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Nowak_65-2">[65]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Axtell_66-2">[66]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Epstein_67-2">[67]</sup> Another hands-on example of generative processes is John Horton Conway's playable Game of Life.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-68">[68]</sup> Nassim Taleb is wary of such models, and coined the term "ludic fallacy."

<p>Certain philosophers of science argue that, while causal determinism (in which everything including the brain/mind is subject to the laws of causality) is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the brain reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-69">[69]</sup>

<p>Many mathematical models of physical systems are deterministic. This is true of most models involving differential equations (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called stochastic. Because of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to numerical instability and a finite amount of precision in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-70">[70]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-71">[71]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-72">[72]</sup>

<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, quantum mechanicsâthe physics of the extremely smallâhas revealed previously concealed aspects of events. Before that, Newtonian physicsâthe physics of everyday lifeâdominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an approximation to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, absolute knowledge of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce an absolutely accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Quantum_realm">Quantum realm</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>Quantum physics works differently in many ways from Newtonian physics. Physicist Aaron D. O'Connell explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does. O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale. O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-73">[73]</sup> Quantum mechanics is the product of a careful application of the scientific method, logic and empiricism. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is frequently confused with the observer effect. The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same timeâif we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose accuracy in measuring the other. "These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Heisenberg1930_74-0">[74]</sup>
</p>

<p>This is where statistical mechanics come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. "Path" is a classical, practical attribute in our everyday life, but one that quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived path of the particle). As Stephen Hawking explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-GDesign_75-0">[75]</sup> In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development is at least as predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes wave functions that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many applications, and allow us to build transistors and lasers. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the Internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-WhatIsItGoodFor?_76-0">[76]</sup>
</p><p>On the topic of predictable probabilities, the double-slit experiments are a popular example. Photons are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. They do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way it might be expected of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, and the distribution of its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but there is no way to predict where in the resulting interference pattern any individual photon will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use weak measurement to acquire more information without violating the uncertainty principle).
</p><p>Some (including Albert Einstein) have argued that the inability to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-77">[77]</sup> The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws can be observed or deduced, there are also hidden factors or "hidden variables" that determine <i>absolutely</i> in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it only <i>appears</i> that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.
</p><p>John S. Bell criticized Einstein's work in his famous Bell's theorem, which, under a strict set of assumptions, demonstrates that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions that would be violated if local hidden variables really existed. A number of experiments have tried to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated. Current experiments continue to verify the result, including the 2015 "Loophole Free Test" that plugged all known sources of error and the 2017 "Cosmic Bell Test" experiment that used cosmic data streaming from different directions toward the Earth, precluding the possibility the sources of data could have had prior interactions. 
</p><p>Bell's theorem has been criticized from the perspective of its strict set of assumptions. A foundational assumption to quantum mechanics is the Principle of locality. To abandon this assumption would require the construction of a non-local hidden variable theory. Therefore, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-78">[78]</sup> An example is the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics. Bohm's Interpretation, though, violates special relativity and it is highly controversial whether or not it can be reconciled without giving up on determinism. 
</p><p>Another foundational assumption to quantum mechanics is that of free will,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-79">[79]</sup> which has been argued<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-80">[80]</sup> to be foundational to the scientific method as a whole. Bell acknowledged that abandoning this assumption would both allow for the maintenance of determinism as well as locality.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-81">[81]</sup> This perspective is known as superdeterminism, and is defended by some physicists such as Sabine Hossenfelder and Tim Palmer.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-82">[82]</sup>
</p><p>More advanced variations on these arguments include quantum contextuality, by Bell, Simon B. Kochen and Ernst Specker, which argues that hidden variable theories cannot be "sensible", meaning that the values of the hidden variables inherently depend on the devices used to measure them.
</p><p>This debate is relevant because there are possibly specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see SchrÃ¶dinger's cat â a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).
</p><p>Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined. This was the subject of the famous BohrâEinstein debates between Einstein and Niels Bohr and there is still no consensus.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-83">[83]</sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-84">[84]</sup>
</p><p>Adequate determinism (see Varieties, above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls libertarian free will "just an illusion".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-GDesign_75-1">[75]</sup>
