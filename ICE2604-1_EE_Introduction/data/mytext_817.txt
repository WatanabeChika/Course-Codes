It is often referred to as a condiment, but unlike traditional western condiments like salt, pepper, mustard and horseradish that make dishes more spicy, a dish of dahi or raita has a cooling effect to contrast with spicy curries and kebabs that are the main fare of some Asian cuisines. In Indian cuisine, some type of flatbread may be eaten together with raita, chutneys and pickles.The yogurt may be seasoned with coriander, roasted cumin seeds, mint, cayenne pepper, chaat masala and other herbs and spices.The word raita first appeared in print around the 19th century; it comes from the Hindi language.[1] The word raita in Bengali language and Hindi is a portmanteau of the Sanskrit word rajika or the derivative Hindi rai (pronounced "ra-ee") meaning black mustard seed,  and tiktaka, meaning sharp or pungent.[2]In South India, especially Kerala and Tamil Nadu, traditional raita is called pachadi.[3]In Eastern Nepal, the dish is known as dahi kakro (lit.'Yogurt cucumber'), whereas in western regions of Nepal it is known as raito.[4][5]Raita is also sometimes simply called dahi, or "sourmilk", after its main ingredient, particularly in South African Indian cuisine.[]Cumin () and black mustard () are fried.  This tempering is then mixed with minced, raw vegetables or fruits (such as cucumber, onion, carrot, pineapple, papaya) and yogurt.[6]Raw ginger and garlic paste, green chili paste, and sometimes mustard paste are used to enrich flavour.[]A variety of raita of India varies from region to region, most notable raithas are boondi raitha—tiny balls of fried gram flour (chickpea flour), which may taste salty or tīkhā (spicy) and onion raita and vegetable raita. The mixture is served chilled. Raita may cool the palate when eating spicy Indian dishes.[7]Raitas can be prepared with three main base ingredients: vegetables, pulses and fruits. These are mixed with yogurt and flavoured with a variety of seasonings to make different types of raita.[8]Bathua ka raita, popular in Haryana in winters[9]Cucumber raitaLauki (bottle gourd/calabash) raita, popular in Haryana and Uttar PradeshBeetroot raitaBrinjal raitaCarrot raitaChili salt raita, could be chopped fresh chilies or just the dried chili powderHorned melon raitaMint and peanut raitaOnion coriander spring onion raitaOnion tomato raitaPotato raitaPumpkin raitaSpinach raitaGarlic mint raitaBanana raitaMango raitaGuava raitaGrape raitaPineapple raitaPomegranate raitaPear raitaMade either from sprouted pulses, roasted pulses or other condiments made from pulse flour.Bhujia sev raitaBoondi raitaSprouted green gram raitaRaita is served as a side dish to be eaten with main course dishes.[8]BiryaniPulav (pilaf)Seekh kababParathaPav bhajiIndian ThaliGrilled chickenSalmonTacosSaladsPasta saladTzatziki, a similar dish found in Eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisinePachadi, a South Indian pickle side dish similar to RaitaChukauni, a Nepalese potato side dishListsList of condimentsList of dipsList of yogurt-based dishes and beverages
