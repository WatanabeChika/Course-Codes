In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 9.In Ancient Greek, θ represented the aspirated voiceless dental plosive IPA: , but in Modern Greek it represents the voiceless dental fricative IPA: .In its archaic form, θ was written as a cross within a circle (as in the Etruscan  or ), and later, as a line or point in circle ( or ).The cursive form ϑ was retained by Unicode as   , separate from   . (There is also   ). For the purpose of writing Greek text, the two can be font variants of a single character, but θ and ϑ are also used as distinct symbols in technical and mathematical contexts. Extensive lists of examples follow below at Mathematics and Science.    (script theta) is also common in biblical and theological usage e.g. πρόϑεσις instead of πρόθεσις (means placing in public or laying out a corpse).In Latin script used for the Gaulish language, theta inspired the tau gallicum (). The phonetic value of the tau gallicum is thought to have been .[1] Theta itself is used alongside Latin letters in Halkomelem, an indigenous North American language.The early Cyrillic letter fita (Ѳ, ѳ) developed from θ. This letter existed in the Russian alphabet until the 1918 Russian orthography reform.In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA),  represents the voiceless dental fricative, as in thick or thin. It does not represent the consonant in the, which is the voiced dental fricative. A similar-looking symbol, [ɵ], which is described as a lowercase barred o, indicates in the IPA a close-mid central rounded vowel.The lowercase letter θ is used as a symbol for:A plane angle in geometryAn unknown variable in trigonometryThe voiceless dental fricative, spelled θA special function of several complex variablesOne of the Chebyshev functions in prime number theoryThe potential temperature in meteorologyThe score of a test taker in item response theoryTheta Type Replication: a type of bacterial DNA replication specific to circular chromosomesThreshold value of an artificial neuronA Bayer designation letter applied to a star in a constellation; usually the eighth star so labelled but not necessarily the eighth-brightest as viewed from EarthThe statistical parameter frequently used in writing the likelihood functionThe Watterson estimator for the population mutation rate in population geneticsIndicates a minimum optimum integration level determined by the intersection of GG and LL schedules (The GG-LL schedules are tools used in analyzing the potential benefits of a country pegging their domestic currency to a foreign currency.)The reserve ratio of banks in economic modelsThe ordinal collapsing function developed by Solomon Feferman[2]Heaviside step functionIn pharmacology, the fraction of ligand bound to a macromolecule based on the Hill EquationThe uppercase letter Θ is used as a symbol for:Dimension of temperature, by SI standard (in italics)Dimensionless temperature in transport phenomenaAn asymptotically tight bound in the analysis of algorithms (big O notation)A certain ordinal number in set theoryPentaquarks, exotic baryons in particle physicsA brain signal frequency (beta, alpha, theta, delta) ranging from 4–8 HzOne of the variables known as "Greeks" in finance, representing time decay of options or the change in the intrinsic value of an option divided by the number of days until the option expiresA variable indicating temperature difference in heat transferMeasuring the angle of incident X-ray beam during XRDIn ancient times, Tau was used as a symbol for life or resurrection, whereas the eighth letter of the Greek alphabet, theta, was considered the symbol of death.[]According to Porphyry of Tyros, the Egyptians used an X within a circle as a symbol of the soul; having a value of nine, it was used as a symbol for Ennead. Johannes Lydus says that the Egyptians used a symbol for Kosmos in the form of theta, with a fiery circle representing the world, and a snake spanning the middle representing Agathos Daimon (literally: good spirit).[3]The Egyptians also used the symbol of a point within a circle (, the sun disc) to represent the sun, which might be a possible origin of its use as the Sun's astrological glyph. It is worthwhile to note that  (theta) has the same numerical value in isopsephy as Ηλιος (Helios): 318.In classical Athens, it was used as an abbreviation for the Greek θάνατος (Thanatos, "death") and as it vaguely resembles a human skull,[] theta was used as a warning symbol of death, in the same way, that skull and crossbones are used in modern times. It survives on potsherds used by Athenians when voting for the death penalty.[3] Petrus de Dacia in a document from 1291 relates the idea that theta was used to brand criminals as empty ciphers, and the branding rod was affixed to the crossbar spanning the circle.[4] For this reason, the use of the number 9 was sometimes avoided where the connotation was felt to be unlucky—the mint marks of some Late Imperial Roman coins famously have the sum ΔΕ or ΕΔ (delta and epsilon, that is 4 and 5) substituted as a euphemism where a Θ (9) would otherwise be expected.Greek LifeThe names of many American
