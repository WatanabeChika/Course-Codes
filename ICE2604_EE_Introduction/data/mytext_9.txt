(a,b)-treeIn computer science, an (a,b) tree is a kind of balanced search tree.An (a,b)-tree has all of its leaves at the same depth, and all internal nodes except for the root have between  and  children, where  and  are integers such that . The root has, if it is not a leaf, between 2 and  children.Let ,  be positive integers such that . Then a rooted tree  is an (a,b)-tree when:Every inner node except the root has at least  and at most  children.The root has at most  children.All paths from the root to the leaves are of the same length.Every internal node  of a (a,b)-tree  has the following representation:Let  be the number of child nodes of node .Let  be pointers to child nodes.Let  be an array of keys such that  equals the largest key in the subtree pointed to by .B-tree2-3 tree2-4 treeÂ This article incorporates public domain material from Paul E.
