Apostolico-Giancarlo_algorithmIn computer science, the Apostolico–Giancarlo algorithm is a variant of the Boyer–Moore string search algorithm, the basic application of which is searching for occurrences of a pattern  in a text . As with other comparison-based string searches, this is done by aligning  to a certain index of  and checking whether a match occurs at that index.  is then shifted relative to  according to the rules of the Boyer–Moore algorithm, and the process repeats until the end of  has been reached. Application of the Boyer-Moore shift rules often results in large chunks of the text being skipped entirely. With regard to the shift operation, Apostolico–Giancarlo is exactly equivalent in functionality to Boyer–Moore. The utility of Apostolico–Giancarlo is to speed up the match-checking operation at any index. With Boyer-Moore, finding an occurrence of  in  requires that all  characters of  be explicitly matched. For certain patterns and texts, this is very inefficient – a simple example is when both pattern and text consist of the same repeated character, in which case Boyer–Moore runs in , where  is the length in characters of . Apostolico–Giancarlo speeds this up by recording the number of characters matched at the alignments of  in a table, which is combined with data gathered during the pre-processing of  to avoid redundant equality checking for sequences of characters that are known to match. It can be seen as a generalization of the Galil rule.Apostolico, Alberto; Giancarlo, Raffaele (1986). "The Boyer–Moore–Galil String Searching Strategies Revisited".
