Therefore a biconnected graph has no articulation vertices.The property of being 2-connected is equivalent to biconnectivity, except that the complete graph of two vertices is usually not regarded as 2-connected.This property is especially useful in maintaining a graph with a two-fold redundancy, to prevent disconnection upon the removal of a single edge (or connection).The use of biconnected graphs is very important in the field of networking (see Network flow), because of this property of redundancy.A biconnected undirected graph is a connected graph that is not broken into disconnected pieces by deleting any single vertex (and its incident edges).A biconnected directed graph is one such that for any two vertices v and w there are two directed paths from v to w which have no vertices in common other than v and w.Nonseparable (or 2-connected) graphs (or blocks) with n nodes (sequence  in the OEIS)VerticesNumber of Possibilities10213143510656746887123919406610974354211900969091121536203335451348432939150704142836182448839416915309958908060333807841663501635429109597504951172448520792920733760104112801817831605940694299259528247346411924603887051350945867492816663958981Biconnected componentEric W.
